Hello! My name is Benvin, and I am currently a Bridge to the Doctorate Fellow in the Economics Department at the University of Virginia. My research interests primarily lie in the fields of applied microeconomics and industrial organization, with a particular emphasis in the Economics of Education. 

Prior to attending UVA, I graduated *Cum Laude* from the University of Utah, where I studied Econoomics and Mathematics. Outside of the classroom, I am passionate about photography (you can find my work [here](https://benvinlozada.com)) and remain an involved member of student leadership within the campus community.I am currently anticipating applying to PhD programs in Economics and related disciplines for entry in the Fall 2025 semester.
